# how-to-do-useful-researches
Because of many reasons, there are more and more papers being published every single day. Some of them contribute both to the academia and the industry, while the others are useless. As a 21-year-old kid who want to start up in the future and make real contributions, I will write down my randomn thoughts on how to identify useful papers and how to write papers that can **really** contribute to the society. I admit that as a person who have begun to publish papers as an undergrad student, some of my papers cannot contribute to the society that much. However, I am trying to improve myself every single day. Hope that some day we can all contribute to the whole world.

## Thoughts One: When will the invisible hand of academia become useless?
The "invisible hand" of academia often encourages researchers to focus on highly cited areas, as these fields are perceived to offer greater impact and recognition. However, when everyone follows this trend, it can lead to a concentration of effort in well-trodden domains, potentially neglecting less-explored but equally important areas. This collective bias may hinder the diversity and innovation necessary for true academic progress.
